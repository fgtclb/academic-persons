This TYPO3 extension adds a personal database to TYPO3, with requirements that
are usually used for colleges, universities or public institutions.

The profile data records can be automatically created and linked in conjunction
with the LDAP extension on the basis of FE user data records. The data can be
enriched with data via separate HiS-in-One synchronization. Data records can be
created, edited and displayed in the front end and in different display modes.
