/**
 * Keeps `organisational_unit_sorting` - the sort column of the organisational unit
 * relation - filled, for every contract that joins a unit outside that unit's own
 * form.
 *
 * `RelationHandler::writeForeignField()` numbers the children of the record being
 * saved, so it fills the column only when the **organisational unit** is saved. The
 * usual way a contract gets its unit is the other one: the `organisational_unit`
 * select of the contract form, which editors reach through the inline list of the
 * profile. Without this hook such a contract keeps `0` and sorts above every
 * numbered sibling in the unit's list - and two of them tie, which is exactly the
 * arbitrary order the sort column exists to remove.
 *
 * The rule is the one an inline list follows anyway: **a contract that joins an
 * organisational unit is appended to the end of that unit's list.** It applies when
 * the record is created with a unit, when its unit changes (the rank it had in the
 * old unit means nothing in the new one), and when it is copied or localized. A
 * contract that already has a rank in the unit it is being saved with keeps it, so
 * an arrangement made in the unit form survives every later save of the contract.
 * Clearing the unit resets the column to `0`.
 *
 * Two entry points, because a copy never passes through the data map:
 *
 * - `processDatamap_postProcessFieldArray()` writes the rank into the field array
 *   before the record is stored, so it costs no statement of its own. It runs per
 *   record, in the order the data map is processed, so a second new contract of the
 *   same unit sees the first one already stored and lands behind it.
 * - `processCmdmap_afterFinish()` catches what a copy or localize run created
 *   **without** a data map. A `copy` or `localize` command on the record itself
 *   runs `copyRecord()`, which submits a nested data map, so the half above
 *   already ranks it. A cascaded inline child - the owning parent is copied -
 *   takes the other branch: `copyRecord_raw()` -> `insertDB()` with the full
 *   database row, which carries the new columns over verbatim, so the copy would
 *   tie with the record it was copied from. `DataHandler::$copyMappingArray_merged`
 *   holds every record the run created as `source uid => new uid`, which is what
 *   makes that position recognisable as inherited rather than earned.
 *
 * Registered in `ext_localconf.php` as a `processDatamapClass` and a
 * `processCmdmapClass`. The class is a public, constructor-injected service and
 * holds no state of its own.
